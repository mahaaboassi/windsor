            <p>Feeling self-conscious about missing teeth can significantly impact your willingness to smile or laugh, potentially leading you to shy away from social interactions. Additionally, the absence of teeth can compromise your ability to chew and bite correctly, affecting your eating habits, particularly if you're missing several teeth.</p>
            <p>Dentures, which serve as replacements for missing teeth, can be used to replace either a single tooth or multiple teeth. They typically consist of artificial teeth set into a base that matches the color of your gums, with the surrounding soft tissues in your mouth helping to secure them in place.</p>
            <p>Opting for dentures can facilitate easier eating, improve your speech, and prevent jawbone loss. There are two primary types of dentures: complete and partial.

            <p>Even a single missing tooth can significantly impact your overall quality of life.</p>
            <p>Dental implant surgery stands out as a highly effective solution for replacing missing teeth. This technique involves substituting tooth roots with titanium posts and fitting artificial teeth that both appear and function similarly to natural teeth.</p>
            <p>At Windsor Dental Care, we specialise in dental implant surgery to enhance your oral health. The absence of teeth can lead to challenges in eating and speaking, contribute to jawbone loss which can alter facial contours, and cause the adjacent teeth to shift — potentially heightening the risk of tooth decay, gum disease, and other oral health issues. We provide dental implants as a durable solution for missing teeth, aiming to restore both the functionality and aesthetics of your smile. If you're dealing with tooth loss, dental implants might be the ideal replacement solution for you. Reach out to us to arrange a consultation, where we can assess your specific needs and devise a tailored treatment plan just for you.</p>
